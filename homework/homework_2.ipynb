Latency/lag is very important for the quality of voice calls, and a voice chat implementation in TCP would be both slower and prone to delays since the metadata that TCP packets are wrapped in would need to be parsed with each packet transfer and the state of each browser would need to be tracked. Additionally, small amounts of packet loss would not be too impactful for the overall audio quality of the call, so the downsides of UDP would not have a large effect on user experience.\n",

By abstracting the database system, ORM libraries encourage good coding practices like code maintenance (because the data model is only implemented in one place, code is easier to maintain and update) and sanitized queries. Also, by leveraging the user's existing knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming practices, SQLAlchemy allows a user to implement and use SQL databases without requiring too much knowledge of SQL to get started."
