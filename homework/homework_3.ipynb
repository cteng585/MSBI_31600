    "**matplotlib vs plotly**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matplotlib` library serves as the basis for many of the other popular visualization libraries that are available, including both `seaborn` _and_ `plotly`. Because of its widespread distribution, it is likely that any environment that uses Python will be compatible with `matplotlib`. Additionally, because each plot element is explicitly declared, customization of plots through `matplotlib` is very deep. Thus, creating detailed explanatory visualizations is where `matplotlib` is excellent.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a wrapper around the `matplotlib` library, `plotly` enables cleaner code and more out-of-the-box features if one wants to generate pre-canned visualizations immediately. `plotly` also appears to be more specialized for interactive visualizations, which would be preferred for exploratory data presentations.\n",
